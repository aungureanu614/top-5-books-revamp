##Background

I built this app as a way to find out what the top 5 books of the month are according to the NY Times Bestseller List

##Use Case

Why is this app useful? If you're someone who's always looking for a great new book to read on topic that interest you, this app will be a huge help to you.

##Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://aungureanu614.github.io/Thinkful-API-hack/

##Functionality
The app's functionality includes:

* Searching for top 5 books by topic
* Click on a link to buy the book from Amazon.com
* Get a quick synopsis of any book you're interested in reading from the top 5 recommended by NYT

##Technical

The app is built using:

* JQuery
* HTML
* CSS

##Development Roadmap

Future features to be added to the app are:

* Being able to rate books
* Being able to save books to a list to read later (Could also integrate with the Fullstack App: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/pure-fortress-13675/settings)
* Being able to find similar books from a different API source such as Goodreads
